Simon Game Rules

Simon is a classic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. Here's how it works:

1. Sequence Generation: Simon starts by displaying a sequence of colors and corresponding sounds in a specific order. Each level introduces a new color, making the sequence longer and more challenging.

2. Player Turn: Players must then repeat the sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the same order. Each correct button press is accompanied by a sound and visual effect.

3. Increasing Difficulty: As the game advances, Simon adds more colors to the sequence, increasing the difficulty. Players advance to higher levels as they successfully repeat the sequence.

4. Game Over: If a player presses the wrong button or makes a mistake in the sequence, the game ends. A "Game Over" message is displayed, along with an option to restart the game.

5. Leaderboard Feature: After a game over, players are prompted to enter their name for the leaderboard. The leaderboard displays the top scores, allowing players to see how they rank against previous attempts and compete with others.
